# Oh, hey there!

I didn't get around to setting up this page properly yet, but look at this unicorn below presenting you [Benford's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law) while waiting!

You could also take a look at this simulation of the [epic fight](https://einglasrotwein.github.io/wilcoxon_wars) between the t-test and the Wilcoxon rank sum test against the perils of violated assumtions.

Or did you come here for the [Skeptics in the Pub talk](https://einglasrotwein.github.io/skeptics_praesi)? (Sorry, German)

```{r setup, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE, 
                      fig.align = "center")

library(knitr)
```

```{r, out.width = '60%'}
include_graphics("./pics/unicorn.gif")
```
